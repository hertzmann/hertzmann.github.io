This is my blog, intended for writing about art, computer science, and/or academia. The idea is to have a place for long-form writing that I can write more without worrying about whether each piece is a completed, polished essay. I started with the [Fast.ai blog template|https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/16/fast_template/] which was very easy.
