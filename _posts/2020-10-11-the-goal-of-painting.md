# Things I Learned from Painting, Part 2: The Goal

*This is the second part of a series of blog posts about my recent experience in digital painting and drawing. [Click here for the first part.](/2020/10/05/art-is-a-process.html)*

When starting to draw or paint a picture, I had to have some goals. My high-level goals were easy: learn things and enjoy painting. But an individual painting requires some kind of more concrete goal at the outset.  What is this picture about? What am I trying to do here?  I didn't have anyone to give me goals, no teacher or mentor, no job or school requirements for my work. 

Perhaps my most important evolution here was beginning to understand better how to think about my goals in painting and drawing.


Aiming for realism
----

On one hand, I was trying to make images look as real as possible. On the other hand I knew that, if you really want something realistic, you might as well just take a picture.

I started out solely painting from life, without photography, in order to better develop my skills.

I was trying to make pictures as realistic as possible.
Here's an example, from a side-trip from Oxford:

</center>

This doesn't look very realistic. Does that make it a failure?   Obviously not, because I was happy with it, and I got good comments from friends.  

Here's one out the window of a train, which forms an "impression," which is a sort of subjective realism:

Reference photos
---

At some point, I started to take photographs along with my drawings, so that I could finish them up later. And I noticed two things.

First, putting the photograph next to the drawing made the drawing look "wrong."  Side-by-side, I could see all the technical errors in the drawing, all the ways I failed to capture reality.

Second, I didn't care. I still liked the drawing more.

I concluded I could solve this "problem" by not showing these photographs publicly.

I'll make an exception to this rule, to show one example:
<center>
<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/soup_photo.jpg" alt="Soup photo">
</center>
<br>
<center>
	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/soup.jpg" alt="Soup">
</center>
I like the drawing, but I think that seeing it next to the photo makes it worse.

Eventually, my drawings got to a point where I think they look pretty good even next to the photograph. But I still don't show the photographs. I'll let my drawings be appreciated or not appreciated on their own, without this distraction.


The real goal
---

This seemed like a contradiction: I wanted to make images look as real as possible, yet, I didn't want to duplicate photographs, and I was quite happy when my pictures were not photographic.

I thought back to 
[a book I'd read the previous month](https://www.amazon.com/This-Modern-Art-Matthew-Collings/dp/1841881007), which (in my memory anyway) explained that Matisse and Picasso liberated painting from a focus on representation. Even though their paintings clearly represented real scenes and objects, their paintings are really about beauty, abstraction, design, and other visual qualities, not about reality. Reality provided them a jumping-off point for art, not the goal.

In short, after Matisse and Picasso, a picture is a picture; how well it depicts the real world is often not important at all.  

These  thoughts led me to the following realization, which seems completely obvious, even vacuous, but is really quite important: 

| **<center>The goal of painting is to make a good picture.</center>** |

What is a "good" picture? Well, there are lots of ways that a picture can be "good." For me, "good" does not mean photorealistic. It means that I like looking at it, that other people like looking at it. Depicting reality *can* be part of it. Or perhaps the picture conveys something about my subjective experience. Or maybe it just looks nice.

To some extent, this answers [some of my confusion from college: why not draw that street sign?](/2020/09/15/painting-in-karies.html) Because drawing that street sign served no purpose in that picture.

As [described previously](/2020/10/05/art-is-a-process.html), when I start a new picture, I don't know what I'm going end up with. I start out with some goals, like capturing lighting, but the goals might change along the way. In advance, I don't know what—if anything—my picture will be "good" at: will it be a nice composition? Will it convey the space? Will it fail at all of these things but achieve something different? 

I always start out with some kind of a concrete goal. But, ultimately, **I seek only a picture that somehow achieves *something*.**


Using photography
---

Once I'd gotten more practice with drawing from life, I experimented with drawing directly from photographs. At first, these drawings looked dull and lifeless:
<center>
<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/donau_auen_photo.jpg" alt="Donau-Auen painting">
<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/donau_auen_tree.jpg" alt="Donau-Auen photo">
</center>
It was like the photograph had lost something of the real experience. And that something hadn't been replaced.

Then I found a way to use photographs. One day, I saw an image on a train platform that I wanted to try drawing. But I didn't have time to stop, so I took a picture, and then drew a picture later, guided by my memory, and using the photograph as reference: 
<center>
<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/gare_montparnasse.jpg" alt="Train platform painting">
</center>
This seemed promising, and I kept doing it.

For example, walking down a dark street, this scene struck my fancy. I had a sense of the "body language" of the streetcars, but I didn't have time to stop to draw. So I took a photo and drew this later:
<center>
<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/streetcars.jpg" alt="Streetcar drawing">
</center>
If you saw the photo, you might get a much plainer sense of the place.

Here are a two more drawings from that trip, also made using photographs as memory aid/references.  The first explored the gesture of a church pointing upward in dramatic night lighting:
<center>
<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/st_stephens.jpg" alt="St. Stephens painting">
</center>

And, in the second, I was thinking of the hyperreal perfection of "photorealistic" painters like Richard Estes:

</center>

If I'd been able to stop at these spots and draw, the results would have looked different. Like the other choices mentioned in my previous post, choosing to draw from a photo is one more choice that leads to different styles, different outcomes, not better or worse than the alternatives.
