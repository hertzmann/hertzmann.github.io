# Choices During Painting: A Case Study

There's a myth that an artist begins with an intent or inspiration for a picture, and then just executes on that vision. [I've written a lot about how this is generally false](/2023/03/06/open-ended-exploration.html): art and science often involves discovering goals during a process of exploration. Moreover, [the process of painting involves a continual series of choices](/2020/10/23/planning-and-strategy.html). But I've found it hard to give detailed examples of these points from my own painting. During the process, it's hard to make decisions, it harder to be aware of making these decisions, and even harder to remember the decisions. And there's something about a finished piece that makes it seem inevitable, erasing all the uncertainty that went into making it.

During my recent sabbatical, I painted a picture that, finally, can illustrate some of the decision-making that went into it, because I remember enough of the decision-making that went into it, and there were enough changes of direction to be interesting. This isn't my favorite painting, but hopefully sufficient to demonstrate the circuitous nature of painting.

**The main point here is: I only started with a vague idea of what the painting would look like, and I changed my mind about it several times during the process.**

I did it while looking at this view out of a hotel window:

Here's the full timelapse of the finished painting that I want to discuss:

On the previous day, I'd drawn this sketch:

<center>
	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/adrift/adrift-sketch.jpg" width="50%">
</center>

As a subject for the picture, the building naturally drew my eye. On the second day, I had the same impulse to center the building. But I realized that I didn't want to do that. The building is not that interesting, it's the open space that's interesting. So I made a conscious decision to focus on the open space. 

So I started by drawing the horizon and the building:
<center>
	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/adrift/adrift-frame65.jpg" width="50%">
</center>
But even after this I decided to move the building further to the side. So I moved it and then started painting the beach:
<center>
	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/adrift/adrift-frame155.jpg" width="50%">
</center>
I noticed that I was drawing simple, relatively clean strokes, with the horizon being a set of stripes. I got interested in the idea of doing the whole painting like that, similar to, say, [a Georges Schwizgebel animation](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=339a018dea4bc811&sxsrf=ADLYWILiBBvT_8Kh1URPzdE6MSTzAcvj0A:1729216641991&q=georges+schwizgebel&udm=2&fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWwAFG7ranuZ26H8lR7pf_8AzBs6lnFFuPH6eU3OV27QJxgWOC2pYAfK469oms6rmuT0DrgO-z8kQP827bqZHgXPifb8ex7SqiUCGoRuZWJXeY1uNxcoAMC_f-nAraj5xf8COdvqs9MKDO76-egULliOzk-nkuJHDhQ2SAgJJATfRK6uvL6BjX8gUQdJLF4CMqAwDmwQ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjUy7396ZaJAxVZCjQIHVUZHnkQtKgLegQIEhAB&biw=1020&bih=967&dpr=1) or Diebenkorn: solid geometric regions, rather than the more sketchy stuff I normally do.  Maybe I'd do the whole painting with this simple, geometric look.

The then I started filling in more of the mid-ground region. I composed three main elements in the center, selecting from the real scene and distributing them horizontally on the canvas:
<center>
	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/adrift/adrift-frame333.jpg" width="50%">
</center>

Then I added some texture, enough to get a sense of what it would look like:
<center>
	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/adrift/adrift-frame690.jpg" width="50%">
</center>
This is as far as I got before I decided it was enoughâ€”time to move to the foreground, and leave the rest of the mid-ground for later.  It would have been easy to just spend all my time filling in those details, but it's better to scope out the whole painting first (and I could have run out of time with half the painting being empty). I might have spent more time on the plant than necessary, getting wrapped up in the details and temporarily losing track of the rest of the painting.

There was a lot of texture and detail in the foreground. Of course I couldn't draw all of it. I drew rough versions of some of the shapes in the real scene:
<center>
	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/adrift/adrift-frame932.jpg" width="50%">
</center>
Then I thought I'd draw lots of detailed grass texture, lots of little blades of grass:
<center>
	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/adrift/adrift-frame1131.jpg" width="50%">
</center>
This is a really different style from the simple geometric idea I'd had a few minutes earlier. 

But after awhile, painting all these blades of grass seemed too time-consuming and not worth it. So I pressed "undo" a bunch of times:
<center>
	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/adrift/adrift-frame1334.jpg" width="50%">
</center>
Then I started to use a much larger brush to draw the grass texture:
<center>
	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/adrift/adrift-frame1857.jpg" width="50%">
</center>
And then the rest of the time was just filling things in. Here's the final painting:

<center>
	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/adrift/adrift-painting.jpg" width="50%">
</center>

Here's the portion of the view that contains the elements of the painting:
<center>
	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/adrift/adrift-photo-crop.jpg" width="50%">
</center>

In the painting, you can see that [elements of the view are arranged differently in the canvas than in the photo](/2024/10/16/perspective-as-arrangement.html). The painting contains a few different styles from different phases of the process: the relatively abstract beach and sky, the moderately-texture mid-ground, and the most-textured foreground.

To me, the bottom of the painting has a different feeling from the photo. The painting has more distinct shapes, more like distinct objects, like caterpillars or single-celled organisms or paisley, or more like abstract art shapes. None of this was planned.
