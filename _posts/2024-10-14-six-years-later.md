# Learning from Painting, Part 7: Finding Inspiration, Six Years Later


In 2019, I started painting and drawing on my iPad frequently, especially during a month-long sabbatical in Europe, in which I often spent many hours just drawing. When I got home, [I wrote a series of blog posts reflecting on those experiences](/2020/10/05/art-is-a-process.html). Those experiences—and the reflections from them in my blog—[has driven my research since then](/2024/08/19/journey.html).

Over the years, my motivation to keep drawing has waxed and waned, for various reasons. I feel like I ["should"](/2024/06/21/judgments.html) keep drawing, but often lack the drive.

I've recently finished another month-long sabbatical, including a lot of time traveling and  Europe, where I again spent many hours drawing each day.  

So here's Part 7 in the series: finding inspiration, six years later.

# Still at it

I've never knew if I would keep drawing and painting.  A lot of the ebbs and flows of whether or not I keep drawing depends on how excited or inspired I am around things, and that's varied a lot.

When I first picked up the stylus in 2019, I thought it was really fun. I didn't pursue it immediately, other than a few idle sketches in an airport:

	</p>
	</figure>
</center>

Then, on the first day of my 2019 sabbatical, I did some sketching and found it so rewarding that I made it a conscious plan to put a lot of my sabbatical time into drawing and painting, and kept at it for the whole month.

I thought that maybe I'd lose interest when I got back home. I didn't.  The first morning when I got home I took a photo on my morning walk and immediately went and [painted a picture from it](https://www.instagram.com/p/B6KG6b4pp4D/?img_index=2). My experiences and compululsions to paint and draw had come home with me, and coming home had provided a whole new set of things to try drawing with my new skills in tow.

Drawing has to feel a bit new each time, or I lose interest; I don't want to feel like I'm doing something too predictable, or too similar to something I've done before. Nor do I want to try things that are too difficult.  The longer I spent around my neighborhood, the harder it came to find inspiration, especially during the 2020 pandemic lockdowns.  At first, while stuck at home, I drew still-lives of things around my house:

and the sights while having drinks with friends in the parks or on our patios

In December 2020, I went on a hike with friends, on the eve of a new lockdown mandating that we not see other people for awhile, and I drew this sketch of the SF skyline, just using my finger on my phone:

</center>

But, after enough drawings of still lives, hikes, patio dinners, and a few other common themes, I ran low on inspiration at home and did not draw much; even the sights on our regular city hikes became too familiar.   


After vaccination,

I started traveling again, which offered even more new sources of inspiration for a few years. 


By 2023, however, I felt the inspiration ebb, until I started volunteering at an animal shelter, and found new motivation in drawing and sharing pictures of the dogs I worked with:

</center>

([Here's a book I made of last year's dog drawings](https://www.blurb.com/bookstore/invited/10173468/a72d12f01ce73d7fd7d284a930d192e4d4cb11c8); perhaps it deserves its own blog post.) The dog pictures are always drawn from photos. And, while drawing from life is important to me, [I find drawing from photos to be useful too,]() as in the vaccination photo above. Animals don't sit still for portraits.

But after over a year of drawing shelter dogs, I've lost momentum there too.

Sketching beverages has somehow kept my interest, especially my morning espresso, especially while traveling. It's become a warm-up for days when I'm drawing a lot; it's in a "sweet spot" of being visually interesting (to me), but not extremely complicated. Lots of complexity that can be drawn but needn't be.

On my recent sabbatical, I thought it would be interesting to go back and draw pictures at places in Oxford where [I'd had some memorable drawing experiences](/2020/10/05/art-is-a-process.html) in my first sabbatical. But when I got to them I never found much desire to try drawing them again.

**Finding the excitment, inspiration, and space to draw is a continual challenge.** It's partly the sense that there's something _interesting_ about trying to draw this thing: it's not too "easy" for me, or too difficult, but enough of a stretch.  Even when I have the time, it's sometimes a tough decision whether to start—if I start on this, will it work out? Will it be better than something else I might find to draw instead, or doing something else, like, say, going for a walk or reading a book?

Over the years, these experiences with drawing have been a bit of a positive spiral: going around in circles revisiting familiar subjects, only after I'd learned something from the previous iteration. But it only seems that way in retrospect; in the moment, it often feels like a difficult search for motivation, inspiration, and something worthwhile. I've left out of a lot of false starts and disappointing drawings from these pages.

My painting experiences in 2019 were amazing, full of new discoveries, and this current one has been more incremental.  [This fits my experience in learning other skills: you start out learning a lot quickly and being very excited, and then the pace slows as learning deepens](/2021/08/17/learning-skills.html). 



**My best new experience this time** came from drawing longer, larger pictures. In Fall 2019, I tried making one very-involved, large scale painting. I sketched it on-site and then painted in details over many hours, using a photographic reference. I was ultimately disappointed in [how it came out](https://www.instagram.com/p/B6bLjqdJlz1/?img_index=1). 

One day of my sabbatical this year, I'd spent the day wandering around, working in cafes and sketching in plazas. Later in the day, I wandered into a cathedral, and, after exploring the place, sat down to begin a big drawing. The place was peaceful, with choral music lightly playing in the background; not too many people around, and no feeling of pressure to get things done quickly. Most of my drawings are relatively quick sketches, but I ended up spending 70 minutes working on this one:

I was very happy with it. When I walked out of the church, I felt serene.
