# When Machines Change Art

At a few times in history, new technologies came along that changed the way we make art. Machines, chemicals, and/or algorithms replaced some of the steps that artists did, changing how we made art—and, sometimes, radically transforming what we thought think art is.

Now seems like one of those times.

When change happens, it's surprising. Some people seem to act as though the way that things are now is the way they always have been, and always should be. Others are eager for any change.  A lot of the discussions around "AI" art tend toward these extreme views: "It's not Real Art!" "It will kill art!" or the opposite view that, like, photography, it's just art and there's nothing to complain about.

I'm specifically focused on technologies that automate (or seem to automate) steps of the artistic process. The reality of how past technologies changed art is nuanced and complex, and that's likely true for "AI" art too. What can past examples of such technologies changing art have in common, and do they have lessons for the current moment?

My main thesis here is:

|**New art-making technologies change art in consistent ways, and studying the past helps us understand how things will change in the future.**|

This blog post is an attempt to identify these trends in past examples, and to judge if and how they're relevant for "AI" art. 
By understanding and recognizing patterns in new art-making technologies, we can understand and respond to them better.  Maybe the future won't repeat the past, but at least we can use this history to avoid the naive, superficial takes that treat this as something completely unprecedented and new.


And, identifying these themes is fascinating in itself, if you like thinking about how things change.  [Like many people,](/2022/10/11/amateurs.html) I've always been fascinated by new technologies for making art.  


This expands on an earlier presentation I gave on this (starts at 20:33 in the video):

</center>

Many of the ideas here began in my previous ["Can Computers Create Art" article](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/7/2/18) and [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APkitEWqdKw).

**This is a work-in-progress**

This topic covers many different disciplines, and I have a lot to learn about this topic. More discussion of this at the end of the post.

I am using terminology loosely about what is a new style, a new medium, or a new art form, since these are probably not useful distinctions here.  **"AI" art isn't just one thing,** it's both a faster way to make what we can already make; and a way to make new styles of existing media (e.g., new kinds of images and video, new kinds of art installations, like Mario Klingemann's [Art Installations](https://underdestruction.com/2020/08/29/appropriate-response/)).   Even so, changing the way you make pictures means you'll make different pictures.

# 1. It begins with experimentation

We have so many artistic technologies that we take for granted, but each of them had to be invented, developed, and figured out, and this took years, often decades.

New artistic tools are created by a small group of experimenters. These experimenters are often tinkerers and hobbyists; there's [a special kind of artist that prefers to work in these borderlands spaces](/2022/10/11/amateurs.html), to mix their own chemicals or write their own code. Their early artworks are [experiments in both science and technology](/2022/10/26/experimentation.html), seeing both what's technically possible and what's artistically intriguing.

[Photography](/2022/08/29/photography-history.html) was developed by isolated tinkerers like Talbot and Daguerre. Nowadays we might think of photography as a thing that was just invented by someone long ago, but it really arose from a fertile and complex set of many experiments and attempts to figure out how to build the technology, and many of those attempts are forgotten.

Animation began with experiments like [Winsor McCay's Gertie The Dinosaur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gertie_the_Dinosaur), and the inventive explorations of the Fleischer brothers and Walt Disney. Disney developed the art and science of animation in a focused decade-long drive, culminating in the movie Snow White in 1933. 

The first fine-artists who used computers in the 1960s, people like [Frieder Nake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frieder_Nake), were playing around with very primitive computing tools, before computer monitors or "computer code" even existed.

**These early explorations are largely forgotten** 

I personally never saw [the big deal](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/120542) of some of the important computer art like [Ed Emshwiller's Sunstone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMW15OajuKc), but I imagine it must have been really striking back in 1979. 

Before I started studying these things, I could not name a single significant photgrapher from the first 100 years of photography. I doubt most people could name a single film from the first 30 years of movies or a single early [computer artwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_art) before video games and "Toy Story," or say much about the long history of [musique concrète](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musique_concr%C3%A8te) prior to The Beatles or Grandmaster Flash.


**For now, "AI" Art is largely about novelty** 

["AI" art has developed in a rapid cycle of iteration between new technologies, and artists experimenting with those technologies](https://aaronhertzmann.com/2021/03/11/lifecycle.html). 

For the first period of the neural "AI" art wave (2012-2021), most "AI" artists needed some technical skill to find, download, run, and modify the latest experimental machine learning code shared by research labs.  Much of the best "AI" art came from artists building their own training datasets (e.g., Helena Sarin, Scott Eaton, Sofia Crespo) and/or directly modifying their models.  Even ["AI" artworks with a message](https://kcimc.medium.com/working-with-faces-e63a86391a93) were still very experimental.

When people (like art critic Ben Davis) accuse "AI" art of being focused on novelty, I say: of course it is. The dominant aesthetic of _any_ new art-making technology is novelty. The only way you figure out a new technology is by experimentation. And it's exciting to be there at the beginning, to know that something big is happening, even if you don't know what.




# 2. New media first mimics existing media, then evolves

The artists who first experiment with a medium often begin by mimicking existing new media. It takes a long time—sometimes decades—to figure out the unique properties of the new medium.

**Photography** 

As a way of arguing for the artistic merits of photography, early [Pictorialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictorialism) photographers mimicked traditional painting:

<center>
<figure>
   <p float="left">
   <img src="../../../images/arthistory/david_painting.jpg" alt="oath of the horatii painting"  width="45%"/>&nbsp;<img src="../../../images/photohistory/peach.jpg" alt="fading away photography by peach" width="45%"/>
</p>
  <figcaption align="center"><i>Classical compositions in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_the_Horatii">painting (1784)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Peach_Robinson">photography (1858)</a></i></figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

As photography matured, some painters decided that this kind of realism wasn't actually art, and created more hazy, impressionistic images, like Whister's Nocturne—which the Pictorialists then mimicked:

<center>
<figure>
   <p float="left">
   <img src="../../../images/arthistory/nocturne.jpg" alt="TODO"  width="45%"/>&nbsp;<img src="../../../images/photohistory/morning.jpg" alt="TODO" width="45%"/>
</p>
  <figcaption align="center"><i>Hazy atmospheric styles in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturne:_Blue_and_Gold_%E2%80%93_Old_Battersea_Bridge">painting (1872)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictorialism#/media/File:Clarence_Hudson_White_-_Morning_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg">photography (1908)</a></i></figcaption>
</figure>
</center>

Two developments allowed photography to move beyond mimickry in the early 20th Century. First, the  growth of Modern Art both shifted the aesthetic cutting edge; "art" was no longer about illusionistic painting.  Second, photography had been recognized as an art form by major institutions.  Photographers like [Group f/64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_f/64) began to explore new directions, considering the unique properties of the photography as a medium, rather than trying to repeat past styles.


**Cinema** 

In 1895, the Lumière brothers made some of the first moving pictures:

<center>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DEQeIRLxaM4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</center>

It doesn't seem like much now, but, at the time, it must have been so amazing just to see the pictures move at all.  

Within a decade, people were telling stories with film. The early movies were much like filmed stage-plays, with a static camera, and actors making big gestures like Vaudevillians. It took several decades for artists to develop the language of film, including editing and camera techniques.  Here's a clip of media scholar Janet Murray summarizing this history:

<center>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PyI_b_a_lNs?clip=Ugkx8Q7X89M3Pi2sPpahbz3y4pupBmnjUOoo&amp;clipt=EPi9CBjgvwo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</center>
(sorry for the looping)

Cinema was invented in the 1890s, but the first movies we now think of as masterpieces arrived decades later, like Modern Times (1936), Snow White (1937), and Citizen Kane (1941). (Only if you are a film buff you can probably think of great films that came out earlier, like Buster Keaton's "The General" from 1927 or "Nosferatu".)

**Hip-Hop**

Or, consider the way **hip-hop** [began as house party music, repurposing funk records with turntable and fader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10C-Q3NIlzU). 
The earliest rappers were inspired by [comedians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRS62nccwmw) and [poets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnJFhuOWgXg).  Then the DJs started scratching
<center>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oA-OpvH4CIQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</center>
and turntablism and remixing and sampling culture went [far far from that original party music, into all sorts of far-out directions like jungle music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SaFTm2bcac).

Hip-hop started in the 1970s as fun party music, meant to be danced to and forgotten. In 2018, Kendrick Lamar won the Pulitzer Prize for Music.



**Computer art**

When people starting making art with computers, they consciously mimicked abstract artworks, as in 
A. Michael Noll's 1964 [Computer Composition with Lines](http://dada.compart-bremen.de/item/artwork/5) (based on [a Mondrian painting](https://arthistoryproject.com/artists/piet-mondrian/composition-with-lines-composition-in-black-and-white/)) and
Frieder Nake's 1965 [Hommage à Paul Klee](https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O211685/hommage-a-paul-klee-13965-print-nake-frieder/hommage-%C3%A0-paul-klee-13965-print-nake-frieder/), inspired by a [Klee painting](https://www.mutualart.com/Artwork/Highroad-and-Byroads/9FCBB157DACDFADF).

**Does "AI Art" start out by mimicking?** 

Much of the history of "AI" art is imitation. Most commonly, [style transfer explicitly mimics existing artists](https://mrl.cs.nyu.edu/publications/image-analogies), with lots of "Van Gogh" and "Picasso" styles, and newer diffusion has a lot of ["in the style of"](/2022/05/25/dall-e.html). These are new styles in the spirit of existing artists rather than existing replications. 
More generally, aesthetically, a lot of "AI" art is about mimicking existing things: movie stills, conceptual art, 

The lessons of history is that this simulation is temporary: people aren't going to want "paintings in the style of Van Gogh" for very long (if they ever do). "AI" art may evolve into something very different.

One could also make the case that the popularity of [visual indeterminacy in GAN Art](https://direct.mit.edu/leon/article-abstract/53/4/424/96926/Visual-Indeterminacy-in-GAN-Art?redirectedFrom=fulltext) refers to [indeterminate visuals in Modern art](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/29/arts/design/juan-gris-cubism-collage.html), although without any specific reference in style.  It's more the feeling that's similar; GAN art often "feels like" Modern art because of the indeterminacy and ambiguity.



# 3. The Backlash ("This will kill art / This is Not Art")


The knee-jerk response to new technology is [often hyperbolic pessimism](https://www.amyorben.com/publication/2020_orben_pops/).  New technology can indeed have significantly negative impacts, but the initial backlash typically gets it completely wrong.

**Status quo bias**

In [a 1999 essay](https://douglasadams.com/dna/19990901-00-a.html), the novelist Douglas Adams wrote:

<p>
<div style="border:1px solid black; padding-left:10px; padding-top:10px">
I've come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies:
<ol>
<li> Anything that is in the world when you're born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.</li>
<li> Anything that's invented between when you're fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.</li>
<li> Anything invented after you’re thirty-five is against the natural order of things. </li>
</ol>
</div>
</p>

This is now called [Status Quo bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias), an emotional preference for the current state of things. In one recent study, [researchers' found evidence supporting Adams' description](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09567976221102868).
They described a new technology to participants, and, for each participant, told them a different year of the technology's invention. They repeated this for many technologies and participants, and they found that **peoples' judgments of whether a new technology is beneficial is best predicted by whether it was invented before or after they were born.**

There are numerous famous examples of people condemning new technologies. [Plato bemoaned that invention of writing would ruin ruin peoples' memories](https://people.umass.edu/sharris/in/e491ho/PlatoWriting.htm).  

Sociologists and psychologists have several theories why some people tend to predict catastrophe for new technologies. One possible explanation is that, for some people, it's hard to imagine the benefits of new inventions—which are diffuse and ambiguous—as compared to the very real prospect of losing something we have.  The positives and negatives are real, but they're often not the things that people are afraid of.

**We prefer the music of our formative years**

Something similar happens with artistic taste. So many times have I heard someone say "All of today's music sucks, it was better in the 90s" or "the 80s" or in the days of The Beatles and Elvis. Somehow it has all gone downhill since the speaker came of age.  Indeed, [numerous studies show that people prefer the music from their youth](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2059204320965058). 

My favorite example came when, years ago, I bought a CD reissue of "Getz/Gilberto," the album that made "The Girl from Ipanema" famous, and it included <a href="https://coverartarchive.org/release/07965278-f955-44a5-b41f-ea03a2f3e303/28682913595.pdf">these liner notes by a jazz critic</a>:

<center>
<figure>
   <p float="left">
   <a href="../../../images/statusquo/getzgilberto.jpg"><img src="../../../images/statusquo/getzgilberto.jpg" alt="Liner notes for Getz/Gilberto reissue by Doug Ramsey" width="60%"/></a>
</p>
</figure>
</center>

For this critic, it was self-evident that pop music had become garbage by 1956, and was garbage ever since then.

**Wrong or impossible standards**

I often read things like "AI art is no good because it hasn't give me the same experience as a Rembrandt does", or whatever once provided the speaker with a profound formative experience. 

In respected novelist and activist [Wendell Berry's 1987 essay on why he will never buy a computer for writing](https://classes.matthewjbrown.net/teaching-files/philtech/berry-computer.pdf), he writes (with obvious skepticism) that he will only respect computers as a writing tool when someone uses a computer to produce a work of art comparable to Dante.  Back in 1987 there probably hadn't been great literature written on computers, but surely there now has.   In 2010, [Roger Ebert wrote that video games could never be art](https://www.rogerebert.com/roger-ebert/video-games-can-never-be-art), because no existing game was worthy of comparison to the great historical masterpieces.

It sounds a lot like [Disruptive Innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation), where established players dismiss new technology because it doesn't perform as well as the old thing according to the old standards. But, because it's cheaper and easier than the old thing, it serves more customers and eventually surpasses the old thing. It turns out that the old standards weren't eternal.
 

**At this early stage in "AI" Art, the Weirdness is the point.**

Some of the complaints about "AI" art complain about it looking "off," lacking the personal touch of hand-drawn art. It doesn't look like what we're used to; it doesn't work by the traditional standards of experts. It looks weird.

The weirdness is what makes it exciting; it's a sign that there's something new going on here, and we don't yet quite know what it is.  The weirdness is a sign that "AI" art isn't quite the same artform or tool as before, and that it functions subtly differently.

This kind of [weirdness only appeals to certain kinds of people](/2022/10/11/amateurs.html), as exemplified by  Janelle Shane's blog ["AI weirdness"](https://www.aiweirdness.com/).


**Can technology be bad for art?** 

The effects of new technologies can be complex and nuanced. In the words of [Kranzberg's First Law](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3105385), "Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral".
On one hand, new distribution mechanisms can shift the balance of power, and I'll discuss this later.

But **I cannot think of a single example of a new artistic tool or medium that is objectively "bad for art."** In all the many times people have claimed that a new medium like photography is going to kill art, it's never been true. Not all technology has been great for art, but when a technology leads to "bad art"—like [Smell-o-Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smell-O-Vision)—or it's artistically limited—like [autotune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-Tune)—it doesn't last.  When people say these kinds of things about "AI" art, I cannot take these claims seriously, because this kind of claim has never ever been true in the past.  At worst, it'll be a fad, but never the death of art.

There are certainly those that bemoan new technologies, like Neil Postman's 1985 claim that [the success of television dumbed-down public discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death).  Perhaps television has been bad for society.  That doesn't mean that television is automatically an "artistically bad medium". That doesn't make it good for society, but neither is it neutral; the case isn't simple or clear-cut.

Can you think of a new artistic tool or medium that, decades later, we _regret as an art medium_? I cannot.








# 4. Changing skills, more creators ("This will kill jobs for artists")

On the other hand, the effect of technology on jobs is more nuanced and difficult, and a broad topic in general. Famously, [the Luddites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite) were textile workers that [sabotaged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabotage#Etymology) new machines that replaced their jobs. New technologies do not eliminate the need for artists, but they transform the nature of the artistic process, and the kind of work.  The topic of how new technology affects jobs is an old one, widely studied by economists beyond just the discussion of art.

The effects are different for artistic media and distribution media.  Both the electronic synthesizer and music recording technology were predicted to kill art, and both did transform art, but in very different ways. In this essay I'm mostly talking about new artistic tools, but I'll come back to distribution media in the next section.




**Photography** did replace the need for portrait painters; most of them had to learn the new technology, as portrait studios replaced the inferior silhouette techniques and the more difficult and expensive portraiture. Photography replaced practical drafting skills for architecture and record-keeping, and displaced the veduta painters that sold who postcards to travelers in Italy. But, far more people can use photography to communicate today and make different kinds of art than could paint.
 
**Cinema**, in its early days, required big bulky cameras and lights. Film was developed on strips of film, and editing movies required physically cutting strips of film with scissors and taping them together; just managing all these strips of film was a lot of work. By the 80s, an indie filmmaker could do his own cinematography; the initial development of digital video editing replaced cutting strips of film with moving files around on a computer. Many of the jobs around cinematography and film editing were whittled. Nowadays, many of the videos we watch are made by a single person filming and editing on their phone and sharing on social media.  Filmmaking has gone from a massive, multiperson effort to something you can do alone in your living room. More people are making video—and sharing them on social media—than ever before. Yet, big budget filmmaking and TV are still massive enterprises, huge labor-intensive productions engaging large numbers of skilled crew and technicians.  As the technology has gotten better, the scale and breadth of filmmaking has expanded dramatically.

**The shift from hand-drawn to computer animation** provides one example of this. In the 1980s, Disney animators were scared of computers, fearing that computers would replace them entirely. But then Pixar built an extraordinarily-successful business of making computer-animated movies—directed, written, and animated by enormously talented artists. The computer didn't do the animation, it was a new animation tool. 

By the early 2000s, Disney's traditional cel animation business was in bad shape. Together with Pixar's success, they interpreted this as signalling the death of traditional cel animation. They  shut down cel animation in Burbank, and laid off any traditional animators that couldn't learn computer animation.  Once Disney bought Pixar, Pixar's leadership took over Disney animation and resurrected Disney cel animation, because they loved the traditional art form and Disney's history. Yet, [their first traditional animation wasn't considered successful enough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_and_the_Frog#Impact,_debates,_and_legacy), and they gave up on traditional animation for good.  Audiences viewed it as old-fashioned.  Styles and tastes change, and technology is one of the driving factors.  

But now, there are opportunities for many more animators than before, because 3D computer animation makes smaller projects much more feasible, and computer animation is used throughout "live action" films. Avatar is basically a computer animated movie with occasional actors and sets.  VFX industry jobs are a mess now, but this is more about the business than the technology; Walt Disney had his own labor issues in the 1940s.

The Disney transition to computer animation is actually a lot more nuanced than that simple history. Disney animation faltered in the 2000s because of management dysfunction following the death of Frank Wells in a helicopter crash; most of those Disney animations were quite bad regardless of medium. "The Princess and The Frog" actually made a lot of money, just not the blockbuster success needed to justify its existence. Hand animation styles aren't actually dead; they're alive and well outside the US (using computers heavily in the process, as they had been at Disney), and Sony's fantastic Spider-Verse movies are an encouraging sign for stylistic innovation in American animation. 

When **Recorded music was invented**, musicians were worried it would take their jobs: why go listen to live music when you can buy a record and listen to it at home? 

In the 1920s, [the American Federation of Musicians (AFM) union decried music recording and forbid orchestras from recording albums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Federation_of_Musicians#Technology_and_legislation), a move that led to the growth of recorded folk music. 

Then, in 1927, the first movie with an audio soundtrack came out, and, within a few years, 20,000 live musicians lost their jobs performing in movie theatres.  The AFM launched [a campaign of newspaper advertisements against movie soundtracks](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/musicians-wage-war-against-evil-robots-92702721/), including some illustrations that could still be used today:

<center>
<figure>
   <p float="left">
   <img src="../../../images/cinemahistory/robot_sings_of_love.jpg" alt="1930 advertisement against recorded music in cinemas: the robot sings of love" width="60%"/>
</p>
</figure>
</center>

Then, in the 1930s, the AFM fought against the use of recorded music on the radio.

Obviously, use of movie soundtracks truly enlarged and invigorated the cinema artform: just the idea that you could have music specifically composed and recorded for the movie itself changed the genre, to say nothing of eidetic music, sound effects, and so on.  

Even if the one part of the profession was decimated (performing music in movie theatres), other roles for musicians have expanded greatly.  

**Lil Nas X** is a favorite example.  At one point he was just some unemployed guy in his bedroom, finding beats online and rapping over them. He found a beat by some Dutch guy making beats in his attic—that he'd made by sampling a Nine Inch Nails song—and licensed it for $30; Lil Nas X shared his song  ["Old Town Road,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Town_Road) online, and it became huge...  the megahit of 2019. 

<center>
<iframe title="New York Times Video - Embed Player" width="480" height="321" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" id="nyt_video_player" src="https://www.nytimes.com/video/players/offsite/index.html?videoId=100000006445156"></iframe>
</center>

None of this would have been possible ten years ago. And imagine all the people involved in making, recording, and distributing a record 50 years ago.

Did the total number of musicians making a living from music go up or down (relative to the overall decline of the middle class)? I don't know if numbers are available for this.  It could be there's less room for megastars like Lil Nas X who got extremely lucky.

Likewise, we have fewer painters today, but many many more people making pictures in one way or another.

**The Short-Term versus the Long-Term** 

These debates over technology's effects tend to mix up two different things: what happens to workers right now, and what happens over time.  [It's important to distinguish the short-term and long-term impacts](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3105385).

On one hand, it's hard to look back in history and say "we shouldn't have invented X just so that the people 100 years ago could have kept their jobs."  At what point do we decide that technological progress or artistic development should stop?  At what point in history did we make a mistake by continuing to invent new things or to develop new artistic styles, and why is "right now" somehow that time?  

On the other hand, it does seem heartbreaking and wrong to have a class of people left out in the cold if their skills become obsolete. In the past year, many working artists have shared their genuine anxiety and fear over what these technologies mean for their livelihoods and identities. Unfortunately, we here in the US do not have much of a social safety net, so, if you lose your employment for whatever reason, even just bad luck, you can really be out in the cold.

I've heard a lot of past stories of traditional artists—like illustrators and designed and the Disney animators mentioned above—who were left behind by the transition to digital tools a few decades ago.  Some could make the transition and some couldn't.  (To have it happen as a result of models trained from their own data feels much worse, but I think this is a totally separate issue intellectually, if not emotionally; see point 6 below.) 

Interestingly, in the 1930s, some countries musicians' unions [secured a fund to support performance musicians put out of work](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1929/11/17/92007058.html?pageNumber=164) by sound recording technology.



# 5. New distribution technologies shift the balance of power

In this post I am mainly talking about artistic tools and media, but it's also important to look at the adjacent topic of distribution media: the way new technologies change when, where, and how we buy and appreciate art also transform art.  A lot of the sins that people assign to new technologies are really around the new business shifts that they enable, rather than them being "bad art."

The role of new distribution platforms, [like recorded music](http://cup.columbia.edu/book/electric-sounds/9780231136761), is a big topic with [a long and complex history](https://medium.com/@Vinylmint/history-of-the-record-industry-1920-1950s-6d491d7cb606).  The technologies that enable mass distribution also tend to enable consolidation of power (unless there antitrust mechanisms are enforced); I enjoyed the book [Chokepoint Capitalism](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/710957/chokepoint-capitalism-by-cory-doctorow-and-rebecca-giblin/) on this topic.  [Here's their chapter on how online distribution for music have been a huge double-edged sword for musicians](https://www.wired.com/story/spotify-streaming-playlists-music/). 

Arguably there are fewer musicians now that we have recorded music; we see live performers far less often than we used to, and fewer actors.  It seems like families and friends used to entertain themselves with homemade music at home, a tradition I pine for, especially since I never learned to make music myself.

But there's a gray area: new distribution platforms lead to new styles of art. The transition from live performance to recorded music—and then to music sold in Long Playing (LP) records—changed music, leading to things like [album-oriented rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album-oriented_rock) and TikTok remixes (like Old Town Road) that are only possible with recorded media.  New distribution platforms create new media (but not the other way around).



# 6. External socioeconomic issues are reflected

New art technologies don't exist in a vacuum—they inherit the sociopolitical issues around them. Hip-hop came from dual turntables and faders—as deployed in funk party culture in poor New York neighborhoods. When hip-hop blew up in the 1980s, the backlash said "hip-hop isn't really music" or "it's degenerate." While this was in part about aesthetics (when "it's not music" means "it doesn't sound like the music I grew up with"), it was mostly racism.

"AI" art suffers from many ethical issues, which I am deeply ambivalent about, because I'm enthusiastic about the potential of new artistic tools, but concerned about the harms.

I argue these issues are not really about art. **The ethical issues of "AI" art are instances of the ethical issues of "AI."**

Whether or not it is "ok" to train models on peoples' data without their consent is a huge societal question that's much broader than where artistic training data comes from.  From an artistic point of view, [inspiration and remix are essential to art throughout history](https://www.everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series); it's just direct copying that's generally not been "ok".  Likewise, racial bias and representation in image results have been a problem in search engines, automated ad targetting, and beyond; the question of what to do about it is similar to the question for image generation. And, misleadingly saying that the "AI" software is itself an artist reflects broader problems and potential harms of "AI" hype.

Perhaps the questions of "AI" art ethics will force a broader reckoning of some of the problems of "AI" ethics. Conversely, if we as a society conclude that it's ok to train models on peoples' data without their consent or involvement—which already happens widely today—then it seems like the same principle should apply to "AI" art models as well (provided the outputs aren't direct copies).

In a way, the debate over "AI" art reminds me of the [complex debate over cultural appropriation](https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/restaurants/article/asian-cultural-appropriation-food-sf-soleil-ho-16172795.php), a  conflict of norms around art and different communities that doesn't have easy answers or resolution; the important issues get reduced to caricatures. Still, I maintain it's about the societal issues: I don't think anyone publicly argues anymore that White rock-and-roll is _objectively_ worse than the Black music from which it was originally derived. It's not about the quality of the art, but the way it was produced and who benefitted.




# 7. We rethink what art is

[Different eras have had radically different notions of what art "is"](/2022/09/27/art-eras.html), and some shifts in the definition of art have been spurred by technological change. Even the distinct concepts of "art" and "artist" [didn't really exist until the societal transformations spurred by the Industrial Revolution](/2022/09/27/art-eras.html). 

**Photography** [automated things thought to be the sole domain of human creativity and skill](/2022/08/29/photography-history.html). It led to a rethinking of what "art is" and [the Modern Art movement](/2022/09/27/art-eras.html).

**Hip-hop** grew—in part—from the technology of dual turntables with faders. Hip-hop relied heavily on remix and repurposing existing music, collaging it into something unrecognizably different. This led to a greater appreciation of the role of remix in art, from Homer to Shakepeare and beyond, and the idea that ["Everything is a remix"](https://www.everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series), which [complicates simplistic notions of ownership and copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix_(book)).


Now, **"AI" art** promises something similar, as we attempt to grapple what it means when algorithms appear to be doing things that we thought were the sole domain of human creativity, and we need to revise our understanding of what an artist does—what wasn't creativity but skill, what it means to make art with these tools, and what is the real essence of human creativity.


# Is it different this time?

Extrapolating from all these trends risks overlooking how this time is different. But, so far, many of the claims about how it's different seem hyperbolic to me, ungrounded in the reality of how these algorithms actually work (e.g., people who compare "human artists" to "AI artists").

Moreover, the common trends and the underlying mechanisms line up so well between the current "AI" art and the past examples. A machine automates some stages of the process that people thought was essential to what artists did. These algorithms are generative art, and people have been making generative art for decades.  These algorithms automate more of the generative process than before, but they don't automate the high-level decisionmaking and curation key to many kinds of art. 

These technologies will be highly transformative and impactful, but artists won't be obsolete; we'll always need and value human artists, in some form.

Perhaps the word "artist" could start to describe algorithms. A "[computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_(occupation))" used to be a person and now it's a machine. But even if that happens, people will know the difference, just like we know the difference between a human messenger and Instant Messenger.


# "Laws": First Draft

A colleague recommended framing some of these ideas as "laws," and, after reading [Kranzberg's laws and discussion around them](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3105385), it seems like it's a bit of an art to formulate them.  Here are a few first stabs at some possible laws:

|New technologies for making art are accused of threatening to "kill" art and make artists obsolete, but, in the long run, they enrich art and expand opportunities for people to make art.|

But conversely:

|New technology can hurt established artists in the short-run by shifting the economic balance of power.|

I think these need work; it's an interesting exercise.


# This is a work-in-progress

I'm still developing these ideas, and it's an ambitious project.  This topic crosses many disciplines: Media Studies, Art History, History of Science, Psychology, Labor Economics, AI, Ethics, Disruptive Innovation, and maybe even critical theory and STS.   Just talking about the history of photography, or the Luddites, or dataset ethics _alone_ doesn't do justice to the topic.  There are a whole lot of different ideas here, and, really, there's enough here for a book.

I'm not an expert in many of these fields this topic covers (and maybe no one is).  I still have a lot to learn; next on my reading list are books by Lev Manovich and Marshall McLuhan.  I'd like to publish this as a paper someday, and would be interested in connecting with experts on this.  I'm not even sure where best to publish.
