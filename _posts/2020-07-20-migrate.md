Essay Links on Art and Computation
=================

Here are some blog-like essays and articles I wrote before starting this blog.

Paintings From Karies
-----------

[Some reflections from a painting course I took in college](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~hertzman/karies/), about some of my early struggles in trying to understand art.


How to Draw Pictures: Computational Models of Representational Art
------------

A short, non-technical introduction to 3D non-photorealistic rendering algorithms. I think it's pretty amazing that we have such simple algorithm for making line drawings and paintings from 3D models, and they don't seem to be widely known.

Image Stylization: History and Future
------------
A short, non-technical introduction to the history of image stylization and style transfer algorithms.

New AI art has artists, collaborators wondering: Who gets the credit? 
----------------

[An article I wrote on The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/new-ai-art-has-artists-collaborators-wondering-who-gets-the-credit-112661), a site for academics to write news-like articles for a broader audience. It was picked up by [CNN.com](https://www.cnn.com/style/article/ai-art-who-should-get-credit-conversation/index.html), [Huffington Post](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ai-art-christies-ganbreeder_b_5c818440e4b0d9a64493ad85), [FastCompany](https://www.fastcompany.com/90316932/ai-is-bringing-out-the-art-worlds-worst-instincts), [Salon](https://www.salon.com/2019/03/09/new-ai-art-has-artists-collaborators-wondering-who-gets-the-credit_partner/), and many other sites. 

(Not long afterward, [Artnome posted a much more in-depth article about the Ganbreeder thing](https://www.artnome.com/news/2019/3/27/why-is-ai-art-copyright-so-complicated) that's probably a more complete resource on that particular story.)
