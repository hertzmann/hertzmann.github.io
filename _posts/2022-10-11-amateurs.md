# Amateurs: Making Art at Technological Cutting-Edges



Reading Michael Naimark's splendid essay on [**First Word Art / Last Word Art**](http://www.naimark.net/writing/firstword.html) recently had me reflecting on all the "First Word" artists I've been lucky to meet personally.  As he puts it, First word artists are experimenters that create new forms, and Last word artists perfect them.

In my experience, many artists that experiment at the boundary of new art and technology share some commonalities: a restless experimental curiosity, an excitement for new possibilities, and a general disregard for disciplinary boundaries—especially the supposed boundary between art and technology.   Nowadays [much of the community around artistic technologies occurs online](/2021/03/11/lifecycle.html), which also inspired this reminiscence.

Our conventional popular narratives about creativity fail us in many ways: one way is that they divide artists and scientists into distinct, separate categories. But a lot of artistic, technological, and scientific innovation happens at the intersection.

When artists develop new art technologies—the films of the Lumières, the first hip-hop [DJ techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qwml-F7zKQ)—they're often dismissed or ignored by traditionalists. Then, within a few decades, some of these techniques become the new tradition.

# No tools but the tools you build

Quite often, building the new art and the new tools go hand in hand.  Sometimes it's one person doing both, because the fastest way to get the tool you need is to invent it yourself.

Perhaps the most important technical innovation in the history of painting came from [Jan van Eyck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_paint#Classical_and_medieval_period), who is famous for painting, not inventing practical oil painting techniques. Likewise, [the electric guitar is primarily attributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Paul) to Les Paul, a musician.

By nature, the user interfaces for new technologies, in a word, suck.  You can't perfect the tools when you're still trying to figure out what you're doing.

In other cases, artists and technologists work closely together. There's a certain kind of artist who doesn't build their own tools but loves to work with the latest thing, sometimes they're artists-in-residences at technology lab. The light cycles in Tron were animated by writing numbers on graph paper and handing them over to computer technicians. There was no GUI and no immediate feedback, since it took hours to render a single frame. 
During a brief time I spent at Stanford, I recall Lorie Loeb  urging us to share our unfinished interfaces and not to wait for them to be perfect; she would work with whatever.

During a stylization demo at Pixar around 2009, I recall art director Ralph Eggleston telling us "I want to push the sliders past the ends. Engineers give us these interfaces and try to keep the sliders within safe ranges, but I find the most interesting stuff happens when you push them way too far."




# Restless experimentation and drive

We often think of the tools of the past as having been invented in a single linear march of progress, which obscures the  messy and fervent explosion of ideas that actually happened. People today compare recent developments in image synthesis to a Cambrian explosion, an apt metaphor for these periods of experimentation.

In 2004, my father and I visited the [Institut Lumière](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_Lumi%C3%A8re), home of the inventors of cinema (though Alvy Ray Smith later keenly informed me that they weren't technically the first).  We visited at a time of active exploration of [computational photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_photography) with all sorts of experimental capture and expressive imaging technologies, like [panoramic stitching](http://szeliski.org/papers/Szeliski_FullViewPanoramicMosaics_SG97.pdf) and [light field cameras](http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/lfcamera/). For me, analog photography had only ever been around as normal film cameras. So I was surprised to see some of the same kinds of experimentation had happened more than 100 years ago: [panoramic cameras, weird lenses, experimental color processes](https://www.institut-lumiere.org/musee/les-freres-lumiere-et-leurs-inventions/photoramas.html). More experiments and prototypes  failed than succeeded. But from among the failures, successes emerged. In the words of Ed Catmull, ["the only failure is if you don't learn from it."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2h2lvhzMDc)

Ken used to cite a Borgés story about a nation that punished artists for making art, so that only the truly driven—those who _had to create_—would make art, and thus they only had good art. While there are many flaws in the premise, it's a vivid parable: the artist so driven to work that they willingly undergo torture, and produce masterpieces.  In a way, one might say that producing experimental art is torturous, with software that repeatedly crashes, hardware that often fails. It takes a certain level of passion to put in so much time and hard work on an experiment.

Occasionally I've shown some of my favorite experimental short animations to my students and colleagues, and we marvel at the staggering amount of effort involved. Consider ["The Old Man and The Sea"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNCxNntn2yc), comprised entirely of oil paintings made by Alexander Petrov and his son. It's literally hundreds of hours of work for every few seconds of animation. My friends would point out how utterly mad it seemed, and then I would point out how they spent day after day hunched over their computer terminals, writing code and spending hours debugging just to find a 0 that should have been a 1.

# Amateurs

In 2016 I attended a talk where Michael Hawley argued that [_amateurs_ invented photography,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nic%C3%A9phore_Ni%C3%A9pce) tinkerers who played around with chemicals and made pictures. He pointed out that, while "amateur" has a negative connotation today, it comes from the Latin root _to love_, a refers to someone who is passionate. According to Wikipedia, "Historically, the amateur was considered to be the ideal balance between pure intent, open mind, and the interest or passion for a subject." Hawley told wonderful stories about colorful characters like the flamboyant, baloon-piloting [Nadar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadar), while showing many of wonderful early photographs.  


Michael contrasted TV with television and cinema, which were designed by professional engineers, and digital media, which was "developed by both industrialists and hackers alike, launching our dazzling new generation of expressionists."

Michael himself [won first prize in an international _amateur_ piano competition](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/michael-hawley-dead.html).  He was also kind enough to send me his slides when I asked, from them I drew several photos [for use in my own talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APkitEWqdKw).


But, in a way, anyone making art in a new medium is an amateur, because, by definition, no one has ever used new tools before.

# No boundary between science and art

These kinds of innovators often don't pay much attention to whether something is science or art or both. In Walter Isaacson's biography of Leonardo da Vinci, he describes asking a curator whether Leonardo would have considered his "deluge drawings" to be science or art. "I do not think Leonardo would have made that distinction," the curator responds. He omits a key fact: neither concept ["science"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Wonder) nor  ["art"](/2022/09/27/art-eras.html)  existed during the Renaissance.

In my college education, art and science existed in separate faculties. I made some art with computers, and neither my art professors or computer science professors seemed to know what to make of it. Then, after graduation, I attended SIGGRAPH for the first time, and discovered a thriving community of people combining art and technology in many different ways.  

(Perhaps the many childhood trips to [The Exploratorium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratorium) with my father had some influence on me as well, given their blend of science, art and and creativity. Certainly the Exploratorium [experimental animation screening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_animation) that he took me to when  I was _way_ too young for had a big impact on me, and I still recall vividly many of those shorts, like ones from [Oskar Fischinger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JU3GFgMWh8), [Norman McLaren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_aSowDUUaY), [Alexieff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwxNQYyiKpY), and [Peter Foldés](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U625vX0E4N4). Supposedly Disney hooked a generation of kids on Disney animation by killing Bambi's mother, and sometimes I wonder if that screening had the same effect on me.)

Walt Disney and Pixar each made enormous technological strides in service of their art. Decisionmaking didn't prioritize technology goals but artistic goals. For example, the pre-Pixar teams' race to solve "jaggies" led to  importance sampling, a tasteful choice of aesthetics and algorithms, in contrast to labs that pursued other, worse, tradeoffs.

My thesis co-advisor Ken Perlin is a computer scientist who always seemed oblivious to disciplinary boundaries, like whether or not the thing he wanted to do was computing or theatre or robotics or literature didn't occur to him. He invented his [noise algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) to solve an artistic problem ([expressive shaders](https://www.shadertoy.com/)). In the lab, he would happily code away on his [little Java applets](https://mrl.cs.nyu.edu/~perlin/), and often say with a gleam in his eye: "I'm making art, but I'm just not telling anybody it's art." The Whitney Art Museum later [exhibited some of his applets online](https://artport.whitney.org/gatepages/january04.shtml).  Ken's lab sat artists and computer scientists together, and we were next door to [NYU ITP](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp), where artists explored new technology, like Daniel Rozin's [delightful Wooden Mirror](https://www.smoothware.com/danny/woodenmirror.html) and Camille Utterback's _Text Rain_ video wall. (We also turned one of my papers into [an interactive video installation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDpbJ0y7d_Y).)

Many of these people present as humble and playful, just eager to show you their latest prototype. During one job interview, a congenial Midwestern interviewer happily showed me the latest thing he was tinkering with; only later I found out that [this fellow had invented the laser printer in the 1960s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Starkweather). (This isn't a rule though and often it hides a lot more going on; Steve Jobs is perhaps the canonical example of someone who brilliantly fused technology and design but was also often an awful person.)


# The sociology of art/science innovation

Someone should write a sociology/history of art at these cutting-edge spaces. Many of these experiments are lost to history; I remember being utterly stunned by a 2009 presentation of a seemingly-endless stream of cool inventions  by [Disney Imagineer Lanny Smoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanny_Smoot): who was this amazingly creative guy, and why had I never heard of any of his artistic inventions? (As far as I know, they remain largely hidden under the veil of corporate secrecy.)

A lot has been written about the kinds of places that foster innovation and creativity (like Bell Labs), less about the places that aim to foster these art-technology connections (like the MIT Media Lab and Interval Research).

And so many delightful little experiments are little-known since they don't feed into any larger narrative, like the Wooden Mirror, or Naimark's [Displacements](http://www.naimark.net/projects/displacements.html) which always sounded amazing but I've never seen (maybe Gondry's music video for ["Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OyytKqYjkE) is similar).  Many experiments are "ahead of their time," not remembered like more mature works. Melies' [A Trip To The Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNAHcMMOHE8) is an astounding work of cinematographic magic but it's hard for me imagine having the patience to watch it today.

History only exists when someone writes it. There's just too much innovation and too many cultures and communities to capture them all; the best, most-compellingly written history will become the best-known.

By the way, I highly recommend the book [_The Age of Wonder_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Wonder), a rip-roaring yarn about the adventurers who advanced art and science in the 19th century, and even invented the idea of science.

More people should know that you don't have to keep art and science separate, and that it's fun to play with them together.
