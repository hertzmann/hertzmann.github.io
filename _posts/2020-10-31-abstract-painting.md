# Learning from Painting, Part 6: Abstract Painting

*“Painting is the grandchild of Nature.” — Rembrandt Van Rijn*

Abstract art has always confused me, at least a little bit. Do I like it? What if I don't appreciate it? Does that make a unsophisticated slob? If I do like it, does that make me a pretentious jerk?  If I think I like it, am I fooling myself?  I don't take these thoughts too seriously these days, and I think a lot of people have similar anxieties about modern art.

But, more to the point, even when I've found abstract works that I really like, I've had no idea how to begin creating abstract art. But, in the past year, I've finally found some useful conceptual frameworks to appreciating it, and to creating works that I'm starting to like.  It's led me toward slightly more concrete theories about the aesthetic appeal of abstract art.


*This is the final part (for now) of a series of blog posts about my recent experience in digital painting and drawing. [Click here for the first part.](/2020/10/05/art-is-a-process.html)*  


Tiptoeing toward abstraction
---

In retrospect, a few things things helped me approach abstract art recently. The first was all the time I spent recently learning about the current art scene, and not just the traditional modern artists of the past century, and just looking at lots of images.  

Second, I had in the back of my mind a desire to explore abstraction more, even though I didn't know how to begin.  Sometimes it started accidentally.  Normally, I only use about four different brushes in my drawing app which has literally hundreds of brushes to choose from, so I decided to go through them and experiment with the other brushes to see if there were any that I liked. I started drawing with different brushes, and, even though I was basically just doodling, ended up with drawings that I actually liked:

<center>
	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/brush_test1.jpg" alt="Brush test 1">
	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/brush_test2.jpg" alt="Brush test 2">
</center>
<br>

Are they "good" "art"? Self-indulgent doodles? They didn't get many "likes" on social media, but I still kinda liked them.

One theme of exploring abstraction is that I am even more uncertain about these images than I am with realistic images: how much do I like these images, or whether they're any good, or whether other people might like them. Of course, one would like to say that one is not influenced by the response on social media, in which case one would be shamelessly lying.

**[Working fast](/2020/10/26/time-and-speed.html) became another good way** to dip my toes in the waters of abstraction. On two flights, I drew sketches while looking out the airplane window. The scenery changed so quickly that I could only get a glimpse of an image before it would change:

<p>	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/airplane_window1.jpg" alt="Airplane window sketch">
	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/airplane_window2.jpg" alt="Airplane window sketch"></p>
<p>	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/airplane_window3.jpg" alt="Airplane window sketch">
	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/airplane_window4.jpg" alt="Airplane window sketch"></p>
<p>	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/airplane_window5.jpg" alt="Airplane window sketch">
	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/airplane_window6.jpg" alt="Airplane window sketch"></p>
<p>	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/airplane_window7.jpg" alt="Airplane window sketch">
	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/airplane_window8.jpg" alt="Airplane window sketch"></p>
<p>	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/airplane_window9.jpg" alt="Airplane window sketch">
	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/airplane_window10.jpg" alt="Airplane window sketch"></p>
<p>	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/airplane_window14.jpg" alt="Airplane window sketch">
	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/airplane_window17.jpg" alt="Airplane window sketch"></p>
</center>
Some of these got some very positive feedback on social media, which really surprised me.

Here's one last example, painted literally while walking on the beach, while trying to keep up with my friends, and I had a hard time seeing what I was doing in the sun. So it is fast and loose and roughly drawn, without refinements:

</center>

Despite its lack of appreciation on social media, I was quite happy with it.



Stuck at home
---

Since the pandemic started earlier this year, I've had a lot of time at home.  I painted things around the house for awhile, like this view of my early-pandemic social life:

<center><figure><img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/social_life.jpg" alt="Social life painting">
</figure></center>

As I lost steam with the same old sights of home, I tried making them more and more abstract; occasionally the results were ok:

<center><img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/aloe.jpg" alt="Aloe painting">
<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/abstract_purple.jpg" alt="Purple painting">
</center>

but usually  I didn't like the images, they just felt like pointless doodles:

</figure></center>



Indeterminacy
---

Why and how would abstraction work, aesthetically?  A few theories over the years that have intrigued me. Our appreciation for abstract ought to somehow be an outgrowth of our experience and aesthetics of real-world images. Aesthetics must be somehow be a consequence of our brains and vision systems are evolved to help us survive in the real world. But there are many other factors, making more concrete connections is obviously difficult.

One abstract artist I've always liked is Richard Diebenkorn, in part because you can easily see how his abstract paintings are related to his landscapes. This seemed like a possible way to understand abstraction: as a sort of hyperdistorted representational image. [One paper argues that Jackson Pollock paintings are appealing because they reproduce a certain kind of natural image statistics](https://blogs.uoregon.edu/richardtaylor/2016/02/08/fractal-analysis-of-jackson-pollocks-poured-paintings/).  This is a very intriguing idea, even if the particular statistics used in that paper don't seem very meaningful. Still, both of these ideas seemed far too simplistic.

In Spring 2019, I came across [a fascinating paper by Robert Pepperell on "Visual Indeterminacy"](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2011.00084/full) a term he uses to describe images that appear comprehensible at first, but that defy coherent explanation. I highly recommend reading that paper if this topic interests you at all. (He also at times uses that term to describe the experience before an image has been comprehended.)  He describes various connections of this idea to art history, and, this idea, together with the idea that [modern art values ambiguity, not certainty,](/2020/06/08/wica.html) gave me a better way to think about abstract art. It's summarized by this quote from Picasso: **“When looking at a picture, one should say that the more associations it can open up, the better."**    ([We've recently begun exploring some of these ideas in a more computational setting](http://cybertron.cg.tu-berlin.de/xiwang/tap-project-page/).)


Richter
---

That paper also made me pay more attention to the work of [Gerhard Richter](https://www.gerhard-richter.com/en/), which, it turns out, I really like. It helped that there are several large paintings by him at the SFMOMA that I saw in person several times last year. Watching [a documentary about him](http://www.gerhardrichterpainting.com/), I was fascinated to watch him carefully drag yellow paint across canvases with a piece of plastic.

The next time I tried painting, I tried to do the same. In my previous experiments, abstraction came from working fast and seeing what happened. Now, like Richter, I moved the brush slowly, and paused to contemplate the canvas after each pass, before picking whatever next brush and color felt right. I chose colors to imitate Richter's color palette, and layered strokes until, like Richter says, "there is nothing left to do." I ended up with this:

<center><figure><img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/abstract_yellow.jpg" alt="Abstract yellow painting">
</figure></center>
which I really liked. It felt like a bit of a breakthrough. But maybe I still just doodling? This image got some positive response on social media too, which as surprising as it always is, seemed like a good sign. I asked one friend why she said she liked it, and she said she couldn't say.

It seems like this image, and other abstract works I like, does capture some familiar notions of image appearance: color, layering, texture, shape, corners... I cannot articulate how it works, but I think that there is a sense of indeterminacy, of ambiguous reference to familiar visual structures of the natural world. 

Once I'd done this painting, I tried to create more following a similar strategy. I would often start with some sort of "real-ish" scene, and then add "natural-ish" textures and strokes. Here are some of my favorites that came out of it:


<center>
<p>	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/abstract_clouds.jpg" alt="Clouds painting"></p>
<p>	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/abstract_metal.jpg" alt="Black-red painting">
<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/abstract_night.jpg" alt="Black painting"></p>
<p>			<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/abstract_yellow_gray.jpg" alt="Yellow-gray painting">
<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/abstract_th.jpg" alt="TH painting"></p>
</center>
These last two were experiments with Richter's occasional approach of messing up a photograph or realistic painting.


Here are two that I didn't particularly like, but yet they got more positive comments on social media than the ones I do like. I'm not sure what to make of this.

Window paintings
---

I lost enthusiam pretty quickly; abstraction is really hard! Most of the time it does feel like aimless doodling. 

But, on the morning of September 9, 2020, atmospheric smoke from wildfires turned our skies a dark red-orange, dimly lighting the ground with faint orange light.  It was like alarming and beautiful, like waking up to discover you've been shipwrecked on Mars.  I painted impressions based on the view out my window:

<center>
	<p>
	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/smoke_window1a.jpg" alt="Smoke window painting">
	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/smoke_window1b.jpg" alt="Smoke window painting">

	<img src="../../../images/ipad_paintings/abstract/smoke_window1d.jpg" alt="Smoke window painting">
</p>
</center>

The next day, the smoke descended closer to the Earth, filling the sky with smoke and yellow light:

</center>

Things improved by day 3:

and the skies were blue on day 4:

What Have We Learned?
---

I take away the following ideas from these experiences.

I think that abstract art functions by reference to our past visual experience, but in ways that are richly complex simply because our visual experience is so rich and complex.  Our visual experience, in the modern world, includes not just what the world looks like but also graphic design, photography, the artworks we've seen.  For example, works by Frank Stella refer to our visual experience of graphic design and mechanical objects; works by Louise Bourgeouis combine mechanical and organic elements.

Abstract art combines elements of our visual experience in unusual and striking ways, but there are many very different ways for this to happen, there is no single formula. Some of this may operate at the level of texture, junctions, overlap, and other image statistics that are hard to localize.

Conversely, for me, the experience of painting realistic images was a prerequisite. Just as viewing abstract art builds on real-world perceptual experience, creating abstract art builds on experience painting the real-world. It used the skills I'd practiced and developed for realism: composition, motor control of strokes, contemplation of an image and iteration, building and trusting instincts. The biggest difference was there was no reality to provide a target, I had pick some random starting point and then just try to make a "good image" somehow.

And I still have a very weak notion of how to do this; many of my experiments end up disappointing. And I also have very little sense of which of my images will liked by other people.  Abstract art is hard.

Here's my most recent experiment. It started when I was doodling while watching TV. Most such doodles go nowhere, including this one. Then, later on, I wanted to try out some new features in  a painting app, so I loaded this image (upside-down, by accident), played around with it some more, and then somehow had an image that I actually liked enough to share:

In summary, 🤷 .
