# Things I Learned from Painting, Part 3: Planning and Strategy

In computer algorithms for image stylization, we tend to think of an image's "style" and its "content" as being independent, and we can apply any style to any image.  In my own experience with painting however, I functionnd that the style was a function of the scene I was trying to depict.

[As described previously, the choices I made early on in a painting could completely change the final outcome.](/art-is-a-process.html)  This post describes some more of those choices in detail, how they depended on the scene, and how they affected the final painting style.   

*This is the third part of a series of blog posts about my recent experience in digital painting and drawing. [Click here for the first part.](/2020/10/05/art-is-a-process.html)*


Picking a subject
----

The first choice is what to draw in the first place. During my sabbatical, I got in the mode of looking for things to draw.

If you've ever enjoyed photography for its own sake, or even just looked for nice pictures to take on your vacation, then you've had a similar experience: paying attention to the things you see, evaluating them as possible pictures, considering different framings and image compositions, adjusting image filters or exposure, shutter, and lens settings. It's a habit that changes how you see the world around you, and how you explore.

Picking what to draw or paint was quite similar. That sculpture I saw at the museum would be fun to try to draw; that street scene is lovely but too complex for my skills, and also an awkward or unsafe place to be standing around for 30 minutes.

Just like a photographer builds their intutions about what kinds of things would be interesting to photograph, as I practiced and learned my intuitions about what kinds of things would be interesting to draw grew as well.


Planning
---

When I started drawing during my sabbatical, I would often draw straightahead without much planning:

I'm eager and want to get going with drawing the fun stuff.
But sometimes the composition didn't come out quite I wanted that way.

So, for more complex compositions, I would plan the overall composition first, by sketching an outline:

In this early example, once I started filling in the shapes of the chairs, I tried to draw all of the lighting reflections directly.

I also experimented with a third way to plan, by blocking out solid shapes, and then refining details:

In this case I first blocked out colors, and then painted wet-into-wet to adjust and refine many of the lighting and colors. This example was also one of the first times I experimented with transparency and layering for glassware.

Each of these different styles of planning produced different styles of painting. Planning improved the overall composition while removing some of the spontaneity of the drawing, and taking time away from working on details.

As I progressed, many of my drawings ended up having a hybrid of these strategies, such as in this painting from just after my Sabbatical, which, from looking at the timelapse, jumps around between sketching outlines, blocking out shapes in solid color, and painting in details:

Strategies
---

I came to see the challenge of depicting a scene as one of choosing a *strategy*. I'm simply not capable of producing a photorealistic reproduction of what I'm seeing, even if I wanted to.
For example, a tree presents a big challenge because one cannot draw every leaf, and even drawing clumps of leaves at blobs seems to miss something. Likewise, clouds have rich, subtle, painterly shapes that slowly change before your eyes, and it's hard to know what to draw. In this case, I chose to paint clumps of leaves in silhouette, "dabbing" the virtual brush:

Drawing glassware was also a big challenge: they have complex sets of reflections, layering, and transparency. I experimented with a bunch of different strategies for dealing with this, including using drawing layers and different types of brushes.
Here's a more complex example from a month after Oxford, as I progressed far past the beer glass above. there is a separate specular layer on the glossy surface of the table, drawn with a solid, flat brush, and I used the eraser tool on this layer to create shadows in the reflection layer:

I spent a lot of time practicing shading and lighting, and refining my strategies for painting light, often by painting multiple passes:

or painting wet-into-wet, mixing digital paint on the canvas:

Introspection is Difficult
---

I make a lot of conscious decisions when making these paintings. Yet, looking back, there are so many choices that I can't explain. Just as [I can't predict how a painting will turn out](/2020/10/05/art-is-a-process.html), I can't tell you how I made a lot of decisions along the way.

I spent a lot of time thinking about what my thought process was
I some cases, I look back at a brushstroke I drew that I liked, and I wonder how I chose that stroke. Other times I look at strokes I drew that don't quite look right, and I keep refining them.  Why did some "work" and some didn't? Or maybe they don't look as good as I think at the time, and I won't like them later. Why did I decide to sketch these outlines and not those? All of these decisions and judgements seem ineffable.


, and these blog posts are attempts to organize and communicate those thoughts. 

Moreover, there is a lot of evidence that human judgements of our past decision-making can be unreliable. So it is difficult to explain anything with confidence.

**In non-photorealistic rendering research,** many researchers start trying to develop algorithms by talking to artists or by reading art books. They soon become frustrated: artists have lots of useful things to say about how they work, but these explanations don't translate into actionable advice. In general, I find that artists' explanations for their decisions are like sports interviews: they might reflect how people think, but they don't explain it.
