# Four Important Eras that Define Art 


This blog post describes four Western art-historical eras, and why I think they are crucial to understanding how we talk about art today (at least in the US and Europe).  

Today, we often talk about art in terms of ideas like [intention, inspiration, expression, ideas, beauty, and craft](/2022/09/19/art-definitions-1.html). 
This is actually a mish-mash of ideas from different historical eras.

I suggest thinking of art history in terms of these Eras:

1. **The Artisan Era**: prehistory to the 18th century
2. **The Romantic Era**: the 18th-20th centuries
3. **The Modern Era**: 1900s-1970s
4. **The Contemporary Era**: 1970s-present 

These eras correspond to four "modes" of art, each with their own conceptions of: the function and value of art, what an artist is and does, and the role of art in society and culture, and how artists get paid. In a sense, each mode corresponds to a different "definition of art."  Fully understanding a work involves understanding in which of these contexts it was created. 

I find that separating these modes can help clarify the roles and functions of art.
Art made today might be made in any of these modes. The "Contemporary" mode mainly applies to a subset of the fine art world. 

This division is an egregious oversimplification of history, and some of my scholarly friends might find it unforgiveable. But I find it useful for several reasons. First, it helps us see how our modern approaches to art are really modern, and not universal. Second, it helps see where all of our conflicting definitions of art come from. Third, it helps us appreciate art from these eras better.

This description of the first two Eras summarizes [_The Invention of Art_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invention_of_Art) by Larry Shiner, revised from [my previous post about it](/2022/06/01/art-books-2022.html). I recommend this book if you're looking for less of this egregious oversimplification.

I. The Artisan Era
-----------
_Roughly, from prehistory to the 18th century_

In 1479, the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception began hiring artisans to decorate the vault of their chapel in a church in Milan. They hired a wood carver to craft a large wooden altarpiece for spaces with paintings with carvings and decorations. They hired three painters to paint panels for the altarpiece. The contract for one of the panels, assigned to Leonardo da Vinci, specified that it should contain the Virgin Mary and child. The contract specified the angels on the side, the hills in the background, and even her clothing, "upper garments of ultramarine blue, brocaded in Gold."

Leonardo was one of many artist/artisans hired to produce work to deck out a chapel in a church that would a provide a place for religious worship, while allowing the chapel's patrons to demonstrate their wealth and status.  

Today, we often think of artists as independent geniuses following their inspiration, elevated above mere craftworkers, with Leonardo as one of the greatest artists in history. Yet, Leonardo's contractual fee was far less than that the fee paid to the carver who made the altar. And it wasn't just that he wasn't yet considered a great artist—it was that the concept of "artist" did not exist yet, and wouldn't for hundreds of years.

**The "Art vs. Craft" division is recent**


From antiquity to the late Renaissance, there was no distinction between “art” and “craft," or even separate words to describe the two. There was no specific word for "artist."
Instead, words for “artisan” encapsulated everyone from playwrights to sculptors to woodworkers to leathermakers.  What we now call "the arts" were broadlly in the same category as shipbuilding: they could be decorative, but they were always commissioned to serve a purpose.
Sculpture and frescoes were commissioned for homes and temples; Greek plays served roles in temple rituals and festivals. "Art" had no existence outside of these functional roles.

The Greeks and the Romans did not have a separate word for "art" in the modern sense, using the terms _techne_ or _ars_, respectively, which included all the arts and crafts, and more generally described the process of making things. Plato and Aristotle carefully subdivided concepts but never distinguished "art" from "craft." 

Suppose you were a Renaissance architect, hired to build a new church for a diocese or parish.  Above all, a building must be functional: it should serve its users' needs.   But the design also has other goals: to make visitors reflect with awe, and to appreciate the power and wealth of the church and its patrons, and your own skill.   To complete the project, you must hire woodworkers, stonemasons, carver, painters, goldsmiths, and so on, to create this building that will serve various church functions. Among all of these artisans contributing to the building and its functions are the painters, people like Raphael and van Eyck, who (with their studios) made paintings for altars and chapels. And the commission might be quite specific about the content, like Leonardo's contract for the Virgin and child. 

When we look at Renaissance works isolated in museums or on websites, we see them out of  context of the altar or mansion they were meant for, like viewing a door apart from the building it was part of. 

The arts in the Renaissance was dominated by the patronage system. What we now call art was always made for a specific place, serving a function in an altar or wealthy patron’s house. Artist/artistans worked on commissions from one of a few wealthy patrons. 
Artists had relatlively lowly status in the patronage system, but the Romantics worked to change that.

II. The Romantic Era
------------
_Roughly, from the 18th century to the 20th century_

In 1683, the collection of Elias Ashmole was opened to the public in Oxford, creating [the first public museum in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashmolean_Museum). This invention signfied epochal changes in the role of art and artists—and the ongoing separation of "art" from "craft."  In the following century, nearly all of our public art spaces originated, including painting exhibitions to concerts to literary criticism and even libraries. The first public museum in France, the Louvre, opened nearly a century later, initially to solve the problem of where to store the French revolution's loot from the royalty. 

In the 17th and 18th century, the church and aristocracy diminished in power, leading to fewer patronage opportunities.  Instead, the middle class grew, forming a wealthy secular society apart from religious institutions, creating a public who would view art in public spaces like museums and concerts, and buy art works. Buying and selling art became a public marketplace. Artists needed to promote themselves publicly, and promote the singificance of "art" itself.

The [Romantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism) advocated for revering art itself—and thus artists—as inspired genius, described in religious terms ("Beethoven is not a human, he is a God," said Bizet). Artists must follow their imagination freely; Mussorsky put it "The Artist is a law unto himself." The concept of the aesthetic, coined in the early 18th century, rose to describe artworks as having intrinsic, independent merits, requiring cultivation and quiet, reverent contemplation.  Later slogans like ["art for arts sake"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_for_art%27s_sake) advocated for the value of art separate from any purpose, while also elevating the status and value of artists.

From this period, we get the idea of an artist as an independent genius, driven by inspiration and imagination to create objects of reverent aesthetic appreciation, apart from any functional use. The artist, their inspiration, and their works are treated in near-religious terms. Art emphasized humanistic traits like emotion, reflection, and nature, as a counterpoint to the increasing dehumanization of the industrial revolution.

The separation of "arts" and "crafts" was gendered: the highly-valued "genius" associated with painting, theatre and music was the domain of men, and women were limited to the lowly "crafts" like sewing and knitting. Traditional artisanal roles sunk further in status with the rise of industrialization, as many artisans were reduced to being machine operators. Nonetheless a new kind of role, the designer, who worked within the industrial system but was not yet viewed as themselves an artist.

Other cultures often have to respond to these divisions after contact with the West. In 19th-century Japan, spurred by contact and trade with the West, the Meiji state consciously constructed the concept of _bijutsu_ for fine art, and _kogei_ for lowly crafts.


III. The Modern Era
----------
_Roughly, from the invention of photography to the 1970s_

In the late 19th-century, the invention of photography [forced artists to rethink the nature of art.](/2022/08/29/photography-history.html) This set in motion a half-century of manifestoes, movements, and revisions to the concept of "art"  that we now lump together in Modern Art.  Art didn't need realistic colors or perspective (post-Impressionism, Fauvism), it didn't need coherent shapes (cubism), it didn't have to make sense (Dada), it could depict imaginary scenes (surrealism), it didn't have to depict anything (abstract art), it didn't require skill (conceptual art), it didn't need to be movable (site-specific art), or even need a physical artifact at all (performance art).  And also, photography could be art, depending on the expressive and aesthetic skills of the photographer.

Within a century, we were calling things "art" that would have been utterly foreign as art to previous generations. These things were also often baffling to the general public.  

Artists became thought of not just as independent creators, but mavericks, outcasts, weirdos; like Salvador Dalí with his cultivated eccentricity.  Artists adopted the mission of actively challenging norms and pushing boundaries.  They achieved special status as innovators and creators.  It was often considered a manly business; think of Picasso's revolutionary painting of [a group of nude prostitutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Demoiselles_d%27Avignon), and the image of Jackson Pollock flinging macho streaks of paint, while hard-drinking and carrying on an affair outside of the studio.

Artists resisted the idea of rationality and industrialization that had led to two disastrous World Wars and mass dehumanization. Yet, art became an Enlightenment-esque project toward perfect art. The abstract art movement argued for abstract art as "pure" art, as with Clement Greenberg's writings that elevated abstraction as the highest form of art.  But as abstraction petered out, other movements searched for every greater purity of form (e.g., conceptualism), and others became more self-consciously engaged with popular culture (pop art).


IV. The Contemporary Era
----------------
_(from the 1970s to the present)_

Today, our popular culture largely continues the values and ideals of Romantic and Modern Art. However, the fine art established has moved on from Modernism to what I'll broadly describe as Contemporary Art.  I've written much more about the [contemporary art world](/2020/06/08/wica.html); here I'll talk about how it relates to the other historical traditions.

Even though I see Contemporary Art is just one of many categories we have today; arguably, movies and TV are far more culturally significant.  However, Contemporary Art looms large in our discussions of art and what art can be. When we talk about definitions of art, we discuss putting urinals in galleries and taping bananas to walls as important cases to consider in our definitions of art.

The Modernist notion of progress ended when they'd broken down nearly all definitional barriers of art; almost anything can be art if an artist says so. Postmodernist philosophy attacked Enlightenment notions of progress, which it associated with colonalism and oppression. As a result, the Contemporary Art world doesn't aim for progress or improvement. Instead, it's often [characterized instead as a "conversation"](/2020/06/08/wica.html): a back and forth of ideas. A conversation progresses over time, but it's not Progress toward utopia. Consider a conversation at a dinner party with a sophisicated group of friends: what's most important in a conversation is to say something both interesting and relevant.   

A core value for Contemporary Art is that ["an artwork is an expression of an idea"](/2020/06/08/wica.html).   Within this world, the form can be almost anything, whether abstract expressionist painting (Gerhard Richter), performance art (Marina Abramovic), photography (Cindy Sherman), Appropriation Art (Sherrie Levine), or something new (Ryoji Ikeda), as long as the narrative around the work constributes something interesting to the conversation.  Just making a skillful painting without that narrative isn't interesting, because we've been doing that for thousands of years. Much of contemporary art has abandoned emotional expression, often celebrating work that's highly cerebral.


Contemporary art has aimed for greater multiculturalism and inclusion, foregrounding work by previously marginalized groups and attacking the masculine stereotypes of Romantic and Modern Art.  Contemporary art has also been heavily influenced by the political activism of the 1960s, and become particularly political within the past few years.   It has revisited the arts/crafts division and its gendered, colonialist roots, with, for example, feminist artists [incorporating textile arts into contemporary art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_art#Feminism_and_fiber_art).

These efforts are frequently political and contentious: early attempts by art museums to incorporate indigenous artifacts into their collections, have been criticized for imposing artworld divisions on cultural traditions: why did some indigenous works go to the art gallery and some to the natural history museum? And the whole thing, even more, elevates the Contemporary Art world as the gatekeeper of art when, in effect, it makes the evaluation that "even some tribal artifacts can be art." 
This artworld is locked in a seemingly-endless Postmodern conflict between idealism (the Romantic/Modernist ideal of the artist as independent boundary-pusher; the 60s activist ideal), and recognition of the money and privilege that drive art in the real world.


Art in terms of these Four Modes
=========

Understanding these divisions helps understand different notions of art. I suspect one could formulate a pretty detailed philosophy of art by breaking it down to modes according to these four Eras, each of which is relatively definable.  Here I'll call them the Four Modes, since they all coexist in our current era (and often overlapped historically).




**Everyday art experience**

Most of us live in a world of Romantic and Modern Art (with Postmodern elements): the artist as maverick genius, creating artistic experiences. We consume art for the experiences it creates, how it makes us feel, how it connects us to society and teaches us about the world.  We revere our favorite actors, directors, and musicians, with attention and fandom that border on religious.  We draw a sharp divide between art and craft. Conceptual art is of relatively little interest to most of us, except occasionally as a funny news item.

Our art is sometimes realistic, but often abstract and non-naturalistic. The forms of most of our art experiences are largely Modernist, but with new technologies for creating and sharing these forms.  The most Postmodern aspect of our current moment is [the breakdown of genre](https://www.theonion.com/i-like-all-types-of-music-1819583436).  



**We mostly interpret through a modern lens**

We appreciate historical artworks through the lens of our current world. We don't necessarily care about what the historical artists and their patrons cared about; browsing through Medieval and Renaissance art, we see reference to ancient kings and battles and religious schisms that most of us know nothing about.  

First and forement, we appreciate old art in modern terms. Consider this advertisement from The New Yorker:

<center>

   <img src="../../../images/definitions/judith-ny.jpg" alt="New Yorker advert" width="60%">
</a>
</p>
</figure>
</center>

It uses Contemporary langauge ("claimed ... as a legitimate subject of art") to speak to current activism ("resistance to oppression.")  Arguably, these concepts would have been foreign to anyone living in the Artisan Era—Gentileschi included—when painters were artisans supported by the patronage system.  The linked [New Yorker article](http://nyer.cm/fbhgA1K), which is two years older, doesn't even use this langauge. In fact, the article describes the complexities of her biography that is omitted from simplifying modern narratives.  

So many of our modern Art Icons were unknown or marginal in their times—Van Gogh, [the Mona Lisa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQr4FhbcPMg), Frida Kahlo—but then commercially revitalized in ways that smooths out details of their actual stories: Van Gogh the troubled genius who cut off his ear, [Frida Kahlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frida_Kahlo#Posthumous_recognition_and_%22Fridamania%22) [the feminist icon](https://twitter.com/errafael/status/1574238573452296196). These Art Icons are mythological characters, like Hercules or Spider-Man, not historical artists. This happens throughout art, e.g., Virgil remixing Greek myth to glorify his emperor and Roman values; the different versions of Alexander Hamilton.

Approaching Contemporary Art for someone with an education that ends at Modern Art causes confusion, especially if one incorrectly assumes that the Contemporary art world still cares about progress and wondering "but is it art?"  

I think it's valuable both to recognize the current lenses by which we understand art, but also learn about the historical stories, e.g., to understand both Frida Kahlo's life on her own terms but also her new life as a cultural icon, which are two quite different things.  History tells us lessons about the messiness of real life, whereas the icons offer simple flags to fly.

**Art vs. Craft**

As discussed in [my previous post](/2022/09/19/art-definitions-1.html), the division between art and craft remains confusing.  "Craft" sometimes means "technical skill," and sometimes refers to a whole range of media that, since the Romantic Era, were considered non-Art.

Nowadays, when I hear someone complain "that's not art, that's craft," I want to point out that this division is only a few hundred years old, a product of the Romantic Era. I think it's useful to think about artistic expression and _technical skill_ as two distinct aspects of a work, but how can one say that sculpture is art but [knitting sweaters or weaving rugs is categorically not](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/08/28/its-time-appreciate-domestic-artistry-like-sewing-baking/)?  Simply to define an activity as "craft" is to reopen the artificial divide between arts and crafts.





# Conclusion

These four Eras/Modes definitely oversimplify, and they're just one lens on art. But I find it useful as a tool for understanding some the gaps between different art cultures and goals of art.
