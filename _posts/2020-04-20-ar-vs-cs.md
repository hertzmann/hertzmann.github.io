# Apparent Ridges, Edge Rendering, and Visual Perception

Two of the most compelling algorithms for describing how humans create line drawings of 3D models are the [Suggestive Contours](https://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/gfx/proj/sugcon/) and the [Apparent Ridges](http://people.csail.mit.edu/tjudd/apparentridges.html). Which one is better? In [a recent article](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0301006620908207?journalCode=peca), I provided an explanation for human perception of drawing in terms of Suggestive Contours. However, in quantative studies, Apparent Ridges seem to be better in terms of predicting where people draw lines.

This essay attempts to resolve this apparent contradiction, and explain the role of each in understanding line drawing. I spent a lot of time thinking about this when preparing my article, but decided to omit this discussion for the sake of brevity. I don't know that there are a lot of people interested in these subtleties right now, but I wanted to have it written down just in case.  

What are the models?
--------

The [**Suggestive Contours**](https://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/gfx/proj/sugcon/) algorithm draws lines at dark valleys of a particular image rendering.   The [**Apparent Ridges**](http://people.csail.mit.edu/tjudd/apparentridges.html) algorithm draws lines at large gradients of a particular rendering. Both produce high quality line drawings in different cases, and there are several published variants to these algorithms.  

I won't go into much detail here about how these algorithms specifically work; I recommend the original papers, which are very well written, as well as the method of [Lee et al.](http://cg.postech.ac.kr/papers/line-drawing-s07.pdf); see the survey by [DeCarlo](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.307.216&rep=rep1&type=pdf) for a comprehensive view of these algorithm. Incidentally, [Pearson and Robison](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1457470/) basically proposed Suggestive Contours in 1985, but didn't develop any algorithms for 3D models.


What do the studies say?
--------

First, what does the evidence tells us about which algorithms are better at predicting hand-made line drawings.

The most important quantitative evaluation is the landmark study by [Cole et al](https://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/proj/ld3d/). Human artists were asked to create line drawings from 3D models, and different algorithms. In their experiments, they found that methods related to image edges and image gradients—including Apparent Ridges—were the best predictors of hand-drawn lines. However, there were shapes where Suggestive Contours performed better.  In [our Neural Contours paper](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~dliu/projects/NeuralContours/), we also found that image edges and Apparent Ridges best matched human judgements of how good line drawings looked.  In short, none of these methods clearly dominates the others, but, if you could only pick one classic line drawing algorithm, Apparent Ridges or image gradients will give you the best scores.

In reality, you don't have to pick just one of these curves; [Neural Contours](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~dliu/projects/NeuralContours/) gets better scores by combining different kinds of curves.  I also think that the evaluation of these methods is a little iffy for mechanical objects with creases. I think one reason Apparent Ridges scores well is that it essentially subsumes creases, whereas Suggestive Contours needs to be combined with creases, and combining multiple curve formulations causes issues that haven't been addressed yet by current algorithms. On the other hand, Apparent Ridges (as currently formulated) can't create junctions, e.g., where 3 creases come together, and cases like this are not penalized much by current evaluation metrics.

In a separate study on how people perceive shape from line drawings, [Cole et al.](https://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/proj/ld3d/) found that people perceive shape with roughly-equivalent accuracy from Suggestive Contours and Apparent Ridges (see Table 1 in their paper). ARs did slightly better on models with a lot of creases (especially "bumps"), and Suggestive Contours did a bit better on some other models.

I don't think we've found the best possible line drawing algorithms yet. So far, this evidence slightly favors  image gradients and Apparent Ridges, but it is not overwhelming.  More significantly, I think we need more research to develop more robust and general line drawing algorithms.  (I also think we need more perceptually-valid evaluation metrics; e.g., IoU and mAP on strokes are not very sensitive to junctions and stroke overlap.)



Apparent Ridges in the Realism Hypothesis
-------------------------------

Apparent Ridges is based on the idea that line drawings prefer image gradients, [which I do not believe is a good explanation for perception](https://hertzmann.github.io/2020/04/19/lines-as-edges.html).

How do I reconcile [my hypothesis that Suggestive Contours explain line drawing perception](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0301006620908207?journalCode=peca) with the fact that Apparent Ridges seem to perform better (so far), or, at least, comparably?   

The key idea is that, in my hypothesis, even though a viewer perceives lines as if they are Suggestive Contours _the best line drawing of an object is not the Suggestive Contours drawing_.  (For the sake of this discussion, I will assume smooth surfaces and assume occluding contours are always drawn.)

As a simple example, consider this [3D model (by Keenan Crane)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/ModelRepository/):

![Snakeboard comparison](../../../images/snakeboard.jpg)


Notice the horizontal line made on each platform by the human rendering. I perceive this line as indicating a sloping surface—a suggestive contour that isn't there in 3D. In my hypothesis, this means that I will perceive a 3D surface that is slightly distorted. In contrast, this line is missing in the Suggestive Contour rendering. This makes the perception of shape more ambiguous, and the perceived surface flatter.  That is, the inferred shape is less accurate in this model.

More formally, suppose the vision system should infer a 3D shape that is consistent with the Suggestive Contour model: each line should either be an Occluding Contour, or a Suggestive Contour, and the vision system infers the most probable shape that fits these constraints (possibly with some perceptual uncertainty).  If the artist's goal is to minimize the distance between the perceived shape and the intended shape, then they draw lines that "aren't there" in order to indicate high surface slant that might otherwise be perceived are more fronto-parallel.

Here's a "nose ridge" example (similar to Figures 3 and 9 in [the Apparent Ridges paper](http://people.csail.mit.edu/tjudd/apparentridges.html)), rendered [by Pierre Bénard](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01175) using [qrtsc](https://github.com/fcole/qrtsc):

![David comparison](../../../images/david.jpg)

Apparent Ridges creates a faint ridge on the inside of David's nose that Suggestive Contours does not. I would view this as exaggerating the curvature of the nose, in order to show that it's not flat.

In short, suppose you ran a shape estimation algorithm that inferred 3D shape from sketches, using the Occluding Contour + Suggestive Contour assumption (and creases were handled as well). Then I hypothesize that this algorithm would produce roughly equivalent renderings from each of these different line drawings, and that the drawing that led to the best shape reconstruction (e.g., minimum reconstruction error) would often _not_ be a Suggestive Contour rendering.  This is something that could be tested with the kinds of algorithms that we have available now.


Explaining variability and lines-as-edges
----------------

There are a lot of different drawings you can make that will lead to roughly the same percept. Here is a plot of the variability in human-made drawings, from Cole et al 2008:

</p>

Observe that everyone basically draws the Occluding Contours, but the interior curves are drawn in different ways.  This may reflect the different skills and styles of the artists, but it may also reflect the fact that different curves will give roughly the same shape percept.

This gives a possible way to explain why line drawings occur so often at image edges. In the Realism Hypothesis, line drawing can conceptually be modeled as a process of creating a "virtual 3D scene," with lighting, shading, and 3D shape, and then drawing lines that match this rendering.  Since an artist has many choices for how to set up a "virtual renderer" when depicting an object, they can choose a virtual lighting and modified 3D shape that produces a set of lines that mostly align to the edges of a realistic rendering.  _Even [if image edges do not explain human line drawing perception](https://hertzmann.github.io/2020/04/19/lines-as-edges.html), they might be often the best places to draw lines._
